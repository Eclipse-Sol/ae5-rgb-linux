AE-5 RGB Controller For Linux
===================================

**This is now being implemented into OpenRGB in a merge request on GitLab.** I've also gotten LED control to work on Windows, go check it out! https://gitlab.com/CalcProgrammer1/OpenRGB/-/merge_requests/2997



I've tried to make this as full-proof as possible seeing as we're messing with direct memory. I believe this is now considered safe for others to try now I've gotten the ability to
find Region 2's base MMIO address. You should know that this is provided AS IS with NO WARRANTY!!

**You** are messing with hardware, know anything can happen.
